  <p>Love is the greatest power in the universe. It is the force behind all other forces. It overcomes everything and moves mountains. Love transforms negative qualities into positive ones and turns anger into kindness. At the same time, being in love is one of the greatest experiences possible. The entire world shines in a much brighter light when you’ve fallen in love. Words alone can’t do this amazing feeling justice. That’s because the great difficulty about love is that it is so difficult to put it into words. Perhaps you want to send your lovers some cute love quotes but simply cannot find the right words to express what you’re feeling.</p>
